* A Racket reader for common lisp
[[img:https://travis-ci.org/tgbugs/clacket.svg?branch=master][https://travis-ci.org/tgbugs/clacket]]

TODO named-readtables support absolutely required for this.
https://github.com/melisgl/named-readtables

* Installation
** [[https://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]] (very much not yet)
#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :clacket)
#+end_src

** Manual install
Using =sbcl= as an example.
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/tgbugs/clacket.git
cat "(push (truename #p\"clacket\") asdf:*central-registry*)" >> ~/.sbclrc
sbcl --eval "(asdf:load-system :clacket)"
#+end_src

* Implementation support
This should work on any cl that has =asdf=, and the copy/paste version
below should work on pretty much anything.
See [[https://travis-ci.org/tgbugs/clacket][travis]] for the list
of tested working implementations.
